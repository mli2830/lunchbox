# Introduction

- Stochastic models, incorporating both process and observation error, are necessary for reliable real-world modeling and forecasting of emerging epidemics. This is especially true if we want to be able to produce reliable confidence intervals
- Fitting this models is relatively hard; almost all methods require degree some degree of model tuning
- All current cutting-edge methods use some kind of stochastic sampling, based on likelihood or Bayesian theory (ABC, sequential Monte Carlo/particle filters, MCMC). All are potentially computationally expensive.
- A variety of new methods have become available,
